# The fpm logo

:::{note}
The fpm logo was developed by the Fortran community in [fpm#380](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/discussions/380) and contributed by [@1984logo](https://github.com/1984logo).
:::

The logo for the Fortran package manager (fpm) represents a gift box with a bow forming the letter F.
For the monochromatic version the color of the Fortran logo {bdg-primary-line}`#734f96` is used.
The color version additionally uses lighter and darker variants of the base color.
While both variants are supposed to be visible on dark background, the logo can be produced in light color or as outline to be better visible when used on dark or black backgrounds.
