"Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for "
"Fortran. Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran "
"programmers. It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program"
" or library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it "
"as a dependency to other Fortran projects. Fpm's user interface is "
"modeled after [Rust's Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Its long "

"Manager（fpm）是Fortran的包管理器和构建系统。它的主要目标是改善Fortran程序员的用户体验。它通过使构建Fortran程序或函数库，运行可执行文件、测试和示例以及将其作为依赖项分发到其他Fortran项目变得更加容易来实现这一目标。fpm的用户界面以[Rust的Cargo](https://doc"
".rust-lang.org/cargo/)为蓝本，其长期愿景是培育和发展现代Fortran应用程序和库的生态系统。"
