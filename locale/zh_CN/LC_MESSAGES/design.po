"Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for "
"Fortran. Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran "
"programmers. It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program"
" or library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it "
"as a dependency to other Fortran projects. Fpm's user interface is "
"modeled after [Rust's Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Its long "
"term vision is to nurture and grow the ecosystem of modern Fortran "
"applications and libraries."
