"Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a package manager and build system for "
"Fortran. Its key goal is to improve the user experience of Fortran "
"programmers. It does so by making it easier to build your Fortran program or "
"library, run the executables, tests, and examples, and distribute it as a "
"dependency to other Fortran projects. Fpm's user interface is modeled after "
"[Rust's Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Its long term vision is to "
"nurture and grow the ecosystem of modern Fortran applications and libraries."

"The logo for the Fortran package manager (fpm) represents a gift box with a "

"additionally uses lighter and darker variants of the base color. While both "
"variants are supposed to be visible on dark background, the logo can be "
"produced in light color or as outline to be better visible when used on dark "
