# Fpm documentation

Repository for building the documentation pages for the Fortran package manager (fpm).


## Getting started

### Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-docs
cd fpm-docs
```

### Install dependencies

The documentation pages are created using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).
You first need to install the required dependencies using conda or pip.
This project uses

- [sphinx-build](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) for building the pages
- [sphinx-intl](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html) for translations
- [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the news section and posts
- [sphinx-book-theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the page theme
- [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for markdown support
- [sphinx-design](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the bootstrap building blocks
- [sphinx-copybutton](https://sphinx-copybutton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to allow copying of code-blocks

#### conda

```
conda env create -n sphinx -f environment.yaml
conda activate sphinx
```

#### pip

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build fpm-docs

Build the documentation by invoking

```
make html
```

The website will be built in `_build/html` and can be previewed by opening the page with a browser (*e.g.* firefox, chromium or similar):

```
firefox file://$PWD/_build/html/index.html
```

By default all languages will be built.
To limit the build to a single language subtree, *i.e.* English, use

```
make html LANGUAGES=en
```
